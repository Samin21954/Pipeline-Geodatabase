# Pipeline-Geodatabase
I was the lead GIS Developer for a project to create a comprehensive geodatabase for the Shahid Dolati Oil Storage Facility in Karaj, Iran. I was responsible for the entire project lifecycle, from initial concept to final implementation, focusing on developing a detailed geodatabase of all facility pipelines.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Project Development: Initiated and led the development of a pipeline geodatabase from scratch, creating a comprehensive GIS solution for the facility.

- Data Acquisition: Identified and mapped all pipeline routes within the facility, meticulously tracing each segment.

- Geospatial Data Creation: Utilized Autodesk MAP to convert pipeline route data into accurate shapefiles.

- Geodatabase Implementation: Exported shapefiles into ArcGIS to create a central geodatabase containing detailed information on each pipeline.

- Data Management: Ensured the geodatabase included critical pipeline details necessary for the facility's management, including ordering, maintenance, and asset tracking of the entire pipeline network.
