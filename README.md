# Pipeline-Geodatabase
I was the lead GIS Developer for a project to create a comprehensive geodatabase for the Shahid Dolati Oil Storage Facility in Karaj, Iran. I was responsible for the entire project lifecycle, from initial concept to final implementation, focusing on developing a detailed geodatabase of all facility pipelines.
